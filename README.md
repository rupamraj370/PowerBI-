## 🚀 Project Story  

On June 12, 2025, tragedy struck when Air India Flight 171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner departing Ahmedabad, stalled moments after takeoff and crashed into a nearby medical hostel. With 241 passengers and crew lost, plus 34 lives on the ground, it became the deadliest aviation accident in India in over a decade.  

So I thought of using data to create - Sky Crash Analytics report, with the 2025 bar. In the “Fatalities by Year” chart, a sharp increase sets an unsettling visual echo of real lives lost. Location-wise data shows different incidents over time. Yet a glance at the “Survival Rate” line chart reveals incremental gains in aircraft design and emergency response—small victories that, if sustained, can save countless lives.  

Sky Crash Analytics is built to surface those lessons: every data point is an opportunity to get insights and make flying safer.
